        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          I started to think about this project when we did molding and casting. Since I wanted to do something food themed, I thought doing something that tied with that project would be a fun way to do something out of the box. I ended up doing
          chocolate ice cream cones. From there, I wanted to tie in motion, 3D printing, and laser cutting, which led me to thinking of ferris wheels.
        </p>

        <h3>Use Case</h3>
        <p>
          This could be used at a themed party or event as a fun way to serve ice cream. This would be another way to get more use out of my ice cream cone mold.

      <h2>breakdown of tasks</h2>

      <div class="assignment">
        <h3>CAD modelling</h3>
        <p>Design the carousel including main body, carts, and moving part.</p>

        <h3>3D printing</h3>
        <p>Handle of the moving part of the carousel</p>

        <h3>Laser cutting</h3>
        <p>I will be laser cutting as many pieces as possible due to its quicker time to fabricate and ability to use cheaper materials like cardboard as a test before using more expensive materials like wood. This will most likely include the stand,
          the main rotating body that is holding all of the carts, and the carts.</p>

        <h3>Mechanism design</h3>
        <p>There are a few parts that will need to move.
          <ul>
            <li>Each cart will need to move along a hinge that is connected to the main carousel so the cart will always hang downwards rather than have it be static</li>
            <li>If I have extra time, I will also make a handle that is connected to the main carousel to make it rotate </li>
          </ul>

        </p>

        <h3>Casting</h3>
        <p>I will use the mold from assignment 6 to cast more chocolate ice cream cones</p>

        <h3>Finishing</h3>
        <p>Smooth or paint components so they look more professional</p>

        <p>My current plan is to lasercut as many pieces as possible to speed up fabrication times. <br /><br /> If I have time, I will consider:
          <ul>
            <li>Baking a cake to use as fake ice cream in my chocoalte cones.</li>
            <li>3D printing a handle that is connected to the main carousel to make it move in a circle </li>
