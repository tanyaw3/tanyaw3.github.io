        <h3>Get Inspired</h3>
        <p>
          My family was in town this weekend, so I focused on learning just how to make a box with a CNC mill, which I had a feeling would be hard but didn't know to what extent.

        <h3>Building 3D models and vectors in OnShape</h3>
        <p>
          This process seemed pretty straightforward. I was able to create the shape and then extrude the box. I ended up making 3 main pieces since the edges would be a little different. There were a lot of dimensions involved.
        </p>

        So many dimensions:<br /><br />

        <p>Little did I know that I would have to scrap it later. </p>

        <h3>Export to Kicad</h3>

        <p>
          I'm very grateful for the instructions that Joshua left. It really helped. The one issue I ran into is I couldn't find the origin option until I realized my window was too small and there's no way to scroll to the different icons
          vertically. Also, I kept creating new folders to hold my new gerber file.

        <h3>Export to Bantam Tools</h3>

        <p>
          When I exported from KiCad to Bantam Tools I had to change my plan completely. I decided to scrap my original dice idea since the holes in the dice weren't porting over properly. I was running out of time but still wanted to complete the
          project.
        </p>
        <img src="images/a5/dice.png"><br /><br />

        <ul>
          <li>Approach 1: Try to still create some box, just without the dice design. However, I couldn't get the walls to fit. So I decided to do a different approach using a slot design.</li>
          <img src="images/a5/notrace.png"><br /><br />
          <li>Approach 2: Leverage 2 of the original sides cut and create a slot system that will hold the 2 in place</li>
          <img src="images/a5/bantam.png"><br /><br />
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once I moved forward with the slot design, I kept milling it until it fit.

        <p>Assembly was a lot of trial and error before the final assembly, so by the time I actually had to put things together, it was pretty straight forward.

        </p>
        <p>Once I figured out the tolerances, it was pretty smooth sailing.</p>
