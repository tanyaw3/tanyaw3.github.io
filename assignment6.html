        <h3>Get Inspired</h3>
        <p>
          As soon as I heard we could do food, my mind immediately went there.

        <h3>Getting a model</h3>
        <p>
          I was debating whether or not I wanted to make a 3D model or download one off Thingiverse. Since I wanted to focus on learning how to mold and cast, I decided to <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:451445">download the model made by
            Drawpen</a>.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          As I was drawing out my approach for casting and molding, I realized I would need to cut the cone in two pieces, otherwise, it would be too difficult to pull the mold out.

        <h3>3D Printing</h3>

        <p>
          Printing was pretty straightforward for this. At one point, the filament thinned out and it became a natural break point.

        <h3>Making the mold</h3>

        <p>
          I ended up buying food safe silicone from Make Your Own Molds since it was cheaper than Amazon. I watched a few videos to get an idea of how I could approach making it so that the details of the cone would show up without a lot of bubbles.
          <br />
          A few takeaways
          <ul>
            <li>Use a scale to make sure weights are accurate</li>
            <li>Use separate disposable plastic cups and spoons. One for A and one for B</li>
            <li>Make sure to mix the silicone really well</li>
            <li>Use a paintbrush to first paint the details</li>
            <li>When filling the rest of the mold, make sure everything is airtight. I used a hot glue gun and a solo cup to keep things from leaking</li>
            <li>When pouring the silicone in, pour it from a higher distance so the silicone stretches and there are less air bubbles</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Casting chocolate</h3>

        <p>
          This was also a crash course in tempering chocolate with a microwave
          <img src="images/a6/chocolate.jpg"><br /><br />
          <br />
          A few takeaways
          <ul>
            <li>Don't be afraid to heat up the chocolate but stir a lot</li>
            <li>Use vegetable oil to wipe down the interior of the mold to make sure the chocolate doesn't stick</li>
            <li>Use a little vegetable oil to wipe down the final chocolate cast to help with the bloom</li>
            <li>Use parchment paper to prevent the bottom of the mold from leaking</li>
            <li>I ended up cutting the mold down one side so it would be easier to take the chocolate cast out</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Once I figured out how to cast the first chocolate cone after breaking a few, I was able to quickly cast the rest.
