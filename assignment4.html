        <h3>Get Inspired</h3>
        <p>
          At first, I didn't really know what search term I could use to find mechnical projects. After some stumbling and lucky, I found a lot of wood toys, Automata, and kinetic sculptures.

        <h3>Sketch</h3>
        <p>
          Sketching to get an idea of what I could build. I ended up spending a lot of time using my sketch as a way to track measurements of different components.

        <h3>Building 3D models and vectors in OnShape</h3>
        <p>
          I leveraged Joshua's in-class tutorial and the video that Krista so graciously recorded and uploaded as my primary reference point. While Rhino had a lot of tutorials to show you how to do things, there weren't as many for OnShape. I think
          there may be an expectation that it's so easy to use that a tutorial isn't really needed or it just isn't as prolific. Either way, I spent a lot of time clicking on random things and using the Dimension button to try to force things to be
          the right shape.
        </p>
        <p>I ended up 3D printing a pulley for my handle since I wasn't completely sure how far I would get and I wanted options for my motion.</p>
        So many dimensions:<br /><br />
        <img src="images/a4/dimensions.png"><br /><br />
        A sample of all the shapes I made: <br /><br />
        <img src="images/a4/onshape.png"><br /><br />
        <p>
          Since I planned on using a dowel as a way to hang the Cams that I would make, I had to make a few key measurements and recorded it on my sketch.
          <ul>
            <li> Dowel width- Even thought the package said it would be a width of .25" or 6.35mm, the actual dowel was closer to 6.17mm</li>
            <li> Cardboard thickness </li>
            <li> Wood thickness- Since I would have poles that would work around the cam, I wanted to be sure that the side of the cam was smooth and wouldn't get worn down. So I decided to use wood </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Export to Illustrator</h3>

        <p>
          Exporting to Illustrator is pretty straightforward with a key option to pay attention to when you open the file in Illustrator to make sure you don't lose any of your measurements.
          <ul>
            <li>Select the layer that you'd like to export </li>
            <li>Right click it</li>
            <li> Change the file name and select the DXF format </li>
            <li> Click Export</li>
            <li> Open the file in Illustrator</li>
            <li> Select "Scale by:"</li>
            <li> Change the dropdown that says "Inches" to "Millimeters"</li>
            <li> Change "Unit(s)" to 1 since the original 25.4 is how many millimeters equals 1 inch</li>
            <img src="images/a4/mm.png"><br /><br />
            <li> Change the stroke width to .001 to prepare for vector cutting </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I exported each folder into its own AI file to make cutting easier.

        <h3>Export to STL File for 3D Printing</h3>

        <p>
          Exporting from OnShape to an STL file for 3D printing was similar to the process for Illustrator except you select "STL" as the exporting file type instead of DXF. I doubled the number of pulleys in Cura.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the shape of the pulleys, I decided to generate supports with breakaway.

        <h3>3D Printing</h3>
        <p>The printer at work is still down, so I strategically planned to go in the off hours to have the best chance of getting it. It worked with limited success, but at least I tried. I had to print the handle twice since the filament jammed the
          first time. </p>

        <h3>Lasercutting</h3>
        <p>I'm always forgetting materials and this visit was no exception. Fortunately, there was scrap material that was just large enough for my cams. I used a lot of cardboard.

        <h3>Assembly Execution Details</h3>

        <p>Assembly was tricky. A few things I realized at 2AM</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The pole should NOT come down to a point. It should have had a wide base. I ended up cutting off the point with scissors, cutting one of the excess hexagons into each of its sides, and hot glueing it to the end.</li>
          <img src="images/a4/tips.jpg"><br /><br />
          <img src="images/a4/flat.jpg"><br /><br />
          <li>The hole around the pole should leave enough space to let the poles smoothly move up and down. I ended up smooshing the corrugated cardboard so that it could do this more seamlessly</li>
          <li>Hot glue is your best friend.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Hot glue... the cams together to create a consistent shape</li>
            <li>Hot glue... the tips of the structure so the cardboard is more stable and snaps into place</li>
            <li>Hot glue... a broader base to the poles so it doesn't just tip over</li>
            <li>Hot glue... all the scene pieces to the hexagon and the hexagon to the poles</li>
            <li>Hot glue... your fingers on accident to remind you that you're alive</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Once I figured that out, it was more smooth sailing</p>
