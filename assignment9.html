          A smart device that will show the temperature and time at a glance, so you
          spend more time unplugged in the morning.</p>

        <p>It’s so easy to start your day attached to your phone. The goal of the honeycomb weather clock is to create a functional yet beautiful time piece that will help you get ready in the morning at a glance. This is great for anyone who wants
          to
          spend less time on their phone. It pulls in the current weather, temperature, and time for your current location. You can also select other cities you’re interested in (like a future travel spot or a city where a loved one lives) and see
          what
          the weather is like there.</p>

        <p>Challenges</p>
        <p>There’s a lot of risks that I’m already perceiving from this project that aren’t even
          related to the coding and hardware portions. I have some experience with laser cutting
          and 3d printing and already expect to do some heavy troubleshooting. If those pieces
          become too much of a problem, I may have to resort to more functional elements.
          For the Arduino portion of my project, this will be my first attempt to attach Wi-Fi to it
          and I feel like I may run into some networking issues. If I’m not able to add the WiFi,
          then I may look at a non-RTC clock option to fake a part of the system.
          I may also change the scope, so it’s simplified and more focused on the LED.</p>

          Through this project, I solidified my understanding of code enough to bring my idea to life. I learned how to:
          <ul>
            <li>Use libraries</li>
            <li>Connect to Wifi and call for data by grabbing a string and parsing with JSON</li>
            <li>Serial to Serial Communication- send the data to a receiver (or in this case, the Arduino)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>03</h3>
        <h3>hardware components</h3>
        <p>Implementation:</p>
        <img src="images/a9/circuit.png" width=200 />
        <p>
          This prototype starts by connecting to WiFi and leveraging the Arduino Time Library and Timezone Library on the WiFi microcontroller (Huzzah 8266) to pull the Universal Coordinated Time and convert it to the local time. Once it converts
          it
          to a local time, each number is mapped to a set of bitmaps that activate a pattern of lights on an LED matrix. If the previous minute does not equal the current minute, it will move the minute and/or hour forward on the display
          accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>When you press the button, it will turn an LED light on to let you know that you have pressed the button. Next, the Huzzah 8266 will send a request to the Open Weather API for a specific city and pulls the string weather data from the
          page.
          Then, it reads through the lines of the reply from the server and extracts the JSON string from it. Next, you parse the Json string to grab the current city, weather, and temperature. Since the temperature is in Kelvin, it is converted
          into
          Celsius and then into Fahrenheit. Both the current weather and temperature are printed to the serial monitor with clear start and end markers that will later be used by the Arduino. Then, the LED light turns off and the code moves it to
          the
          next city.</p>

        <p>
          The Huzzah 8266 is connected through the serial ports to the Arduino. Through serial to serial communication, the Arduino receives the serial print string and uses the start and end marker to pull in the data that has been defined as
          important. Then, it parses the weather and temperature and saves them as two separate variables, so it can be used as two separate output signals.
        </p>

        <p>
          The city and weather are printed to the LCD screen. The temperature data is sent through an if statement that determines what color the RGB LEDs should be. If it’s < 50 degrees Fahrenheit the light is blue. If it’s between 50-70 degrees
            Fahrenheit the light is green, and if it’s>50 degrees Fahrenheit the light is red. The color of the lights is set through the RGB color code.

        <h3>01</h3>
        <h3>3D print bee and stand</h3>
        <p>I downloaded both the bee and the stand file from Thingiverse.
        </p>
        <div class="inspo"><img src="images/a9/bee.png" width=500></div>
        <p><b>Print</b><br /><br />
          When printing, make sure to stay with the print until the first layer has successfully printed.
        </p>

        <p><b>3D Print Settings and Details:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Infill: 40% (since I wanted it to be sturdier and have more heft)</li>
            <li>No supports needed for the stand since there was always a stable layer underneath each top layer. For the bee, I used PVA since it was water soluble</li>
            <li>Material: PLA and PVA</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Remove excess plastic</b><br /><br />
          Drop the bees in a cup of warm water and use something to swirl the prints around to help speed up the removal of the PVA supports. Otherwise, wait a few hours.

        <h3>Laser cut</h3>
        <p><b>Before you go</b></p>
        <p>To make sure everything fit, I first laser cut on cardboard before moving to wood. This also helped me realize that instead of doing dots, I should just cut out a rectangle around the clock to ensure the time would show through. </p>
        <div class="inspo"><img src="images/a9/cardboard.jpg" width=400></div>
        <p><b>Prepare the file and materials</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the exported files in Adobe Illustrator including ferris wheel, stand, and booth sides from Rhino and the seat from Onshape (DXF file that can be opened in Illustrator)</li>
          <li>Make sure it's imported in at a 1:1 millimeter ratio</li>
          <li>Change stroke width to .001 pt. It will look barely visible on screen.</li>
          <li>Put each element on its own layer to make editing easier when you laser cut. Sometimes, certain lines won't cut as well if the wood used to laser cut isn't flat. Instead of recutting everything, this gives you the flexibility to only
            cut that one area instead of everything.</li>
        </ul>
